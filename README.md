### Hi there fellow nerd! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Developer hailing from the heart of Kansas City's Silicon Prairie. Currently working for [Dimensional Innovations](https://dimin.com). I love working in [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [Django](https://github.com/django/django) to create interactive experiences.

Since the age of 15, he's been fascinated with the connection between creativity and code. This love for all things tech has allowed me to work for a wide variety of advertising agencies, marketing firms and even the craft beer industry. When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me at home spending time with his wife and two boys or in the pit of a metal show.
