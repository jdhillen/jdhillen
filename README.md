### Hi there fellow nerd! 👋

I'm a Full Stack Developer hailing from the heart of Kansas City's Silicon Prairie. Currently working for [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com). I love working in [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [Django](https://github.com/django/django) to create interactive experiences.

Since the age of 15, he's been fascinated with the connection between creativity and code. This love for all things tech has allowed me to work for a wide variety of advertising agencies, marketing firms and even the craft beer industry. When I'm not coding, you’ll find me at home spending time with his wife and two boys or in the pit of a metal show.
